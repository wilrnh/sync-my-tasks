## Architecture

sync-my-tasks is a CLI tool that copies tasks between apps. Since different apps provide varying APIs for the import and export of tasks, sync-my-tasks abstracts their functionality into _providers_ which are in charge of interfacing with their respective APIs and handling import and export.

Each provider is responsible for either importing or exporting a well defined `list` of `TaskList`s, or both.

`TaskList`: a named `list` of `Task`s
`Task`: an object representing a task, that is generic enough to be imported/exported between any provider.
